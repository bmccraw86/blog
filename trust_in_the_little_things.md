# Trust in the little things

--

I woke up this morning wondering if my wife trusts me.  I don't mean that she thinks I'm dishonest or that I'm working against her, but does she truly believe I'm working for her?  This question stemed from a few little reactions that I typically brush off, but this time they bothered me.  

As I clean the house, I'm always looking for things to get rid of.  I'm a big fan of decluttering, so I'm constantly asking "do we need this" or "can I throw this out" while moving around the house.  For the past couple months, a jar with painted lady bugs on it has been sitting next to my coffee area.  As I turned and asked "what can I do with this?", the response I got was a concerned look of fear that I was going to throw away a prized posession.


* How do big and little things differ with trust?
* What causes distrust?
* Is "trust but verify" really trust?
